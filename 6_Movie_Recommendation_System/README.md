Project Description:-
A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior.
It becomes hard for the system to determeine if the user liked the movie they watch or they never liked it because user never left any ratings.

Solution Proposed :
Movie recommandation system will suggest the movie that matches the similarities of previous watched movies.
The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch.
The ML algorithms for these recommendation systems use the data about this user from the system’s database. This data is used to predict the future behavior of the user concerned based on the information from the past.
The target of our proposed system is to recommend appropriate movies to the users according to the ratings of the other users provided they are in same cluster.
